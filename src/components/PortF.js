      in Chicago. “Brilliant bronze color. Delicate, fruity aromas of raisin
      cake, caramel buttercream, suede, and pepper jam with a silky, lively,
      fruity medium-full body and a warming, involved, toasted fruitcake, cedar,
      exotic spices, and minerals finish. A great well aged sipping rye; try
      with cigars.”

        Dark, robust color with a nose of deep florals, fruit and spices.
        Forward pepper yields to the port fruit on the mid-palate, complemented
        by cinnamon and cloves. Coats the tongue and finishes with black cherry.
        The finish is warming and well-balanced.{" "}
